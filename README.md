## Description

Please read each section to better understanding of the idea behind this project.

- Javascript is the primary language and Bulma is used for the styling framework.

- The API's used are Google fonts, Utelly, and TMDB.

- We built this project with the mindset of being able to help people find out which platforms they can watch their favorite movies or TV shows on with the ease of searching for it on one site. 

## Usage

- Upon loading the page the user will be greeted with a brief description of the app and search bar to look up data. When the movie or TV show is inputed the user is presented with the top searches or, a message informing the user that the search is not currently available on a streaming platform. When the search is successful the user is shown a brief description of the top search along with names, images, and streaming platform links of the related results based on the keyword search. After a search is complete the keyword will be saved and updated to a list of previous searches in the form of buttons, these buttons can be clicked and will display the same results of the prior search.   

Enjoy and thank you!
